# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 3: July 19th, Wednesday (updating on thursday afternoon as per usual)

**Today's Progress**: Reminded myself of things that I once knew but forgot, but I didn't get anything DONE. Further punishment for not approaching my coding studies in a clear and purposeful way. 

**Thoughts:** I spent 2 hours, gnawing through code of HOW I want my portfolio site to ultimately look. The ide seemed solid before, during, but not after. The thinking was to write code, where I would use css to give different section different colors, so that visually I can see the layout. During this process I ran into some issues, and spent time resolving some, and time not resolving others. When I was done for the night, I looked back and felt proud of reminding myself of some things, but I also felt foolish for wastng this time making a mock up. I felt like I should have just put the real INTENDED code, then wasting time putting "DUMMY" code for visual purposes.

Day 2: July 18th 2017

Today's Progress: Added a link to the Tribute Page, as that is a requirement for the FCC project. The link opens in a new window, and leads to a page where more information can be obtained. 

Thoughts: Really feel like I hacked this project together, and would like to get better at planning, understanding the interconnectivity of various page elements, and much more.... It's a process. Stay positive.

### Day 1: July 17th 2017
**Today's Progress**: Realizing that taking time off (especially extended periods of time) is not a good idea. re-learning things that I was so comfortable with back in the winter/fall. I spent my time today working on my tribute page. It's not yet completed, but I made significant progress. 

**Thoughts:** Stuck between a place where I have to re-learn the basics and where I want to move on to JavaScript and more interactive aspects of development.

### Day 0: July 16th 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just getting back into the swing of things after a false start late last year. Today I worked on a few tutorials to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS again. I worked on a responsive sliding menu and also on a pricing table from some youtube videos I watched. 

**Thoughts:** Not as familiar with HTML and CSS as I had remembered. I had to look a few things up, and remind myself of a few things, but I made it through. A very good reminder that I have to stay consistent to make the most of this journey.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
